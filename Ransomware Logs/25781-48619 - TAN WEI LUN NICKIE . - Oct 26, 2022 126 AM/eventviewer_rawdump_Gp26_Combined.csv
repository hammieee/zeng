This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","services.exe","services.exe",752,"-","-","-","SYSTEM, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","-","-","-","NT AUTHORITY","-","-","-","S-1-5-18",SYSTEM,SYSTEM,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",5,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","NT AUTHORITY","-",0x0,"-",0x3e7,"-","-","-","-","-",SYSTEM,"S-1-5-18","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Service,Info,776,"10,068","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2666,Logon,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",2

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","services.exe","services.exe",752,"-","-","-","SYSTEM, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","-","-","-","NT AUTHORITY","-","-","-","S-1-5-18",SYSTEM,SYSTEM,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",5,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","NT AUTHORITY","-",0x0,"-",0x3e7,"-","-","-","-","-",SYSTEM,"S-1-5-18","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Service,Info,776,"10,068","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2652,Logon,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",2

.SYNOPSIS 
Generates a random cryptography key.

.DESCRIPTION
Generates a random cryptography key based on the desired key size.

.PARAMETER Algorithm
Algorithm to generate key for.

.PARAMETER KeySize
Number of bits the generated key will have.

.PARAMETER AsPlainText
Returns a String instead of SecureString.

.OUTPUTS
System.Security.SecureString. New-CryptographyKey return the key as a SecureString by default.
System.String. New-CryptographyKey will return the key in plain text as a string if the -AsPlainText parameter is specified.

.EXAMPLE
$key = New-CryptographyKey
This example generates a random 256-bit AES key and stores it in the variable $key.

<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Encrypts a file using a symmetrical algorithm.

.DESCRIPTION
Encrypts a file using a symmetrical algorithm.

.PARAMETER FileName
File(s) to be encrypted.

.PARAMETER Key
Cryptography key as a SecureString to be used for encryption.

.PARAMETER KeyAsPlainText
Cryptography key as a String to be used for encryption.

.PARAMETER CipherMode
Specifies the block cipher mode to use for encryption.

.PARAMETER PaddingMode
Specifies the type of padding to apply when the message data block is shorter than the full number of bytes needed for a cryptographic operation.

.PARAMETER Suffix
Suffix of the encrypted file to be removed.

.PARAMETER RemoveSource
Removes the source (decrypted) file after encrypting.

.OUTPUTS
System.IO.FileInfo. Protect-File will return FileInfo with the SourceFile, Algorithm, Key, CipherMode, and PaddingMode as added NoteProperties

.EXAMPLE
Protect-File 'C:\secrets.txt' $key
This example encrypts C:\secrets.txt using the key stored in the variable $key. The encrypted file would have the default extension of '.AES' and the source (decrypted) file would not be removed.

.EXAMPLE
Protect-File 'C:\secrets.txt' -Algorithm DES -Suffix '.Encrypted' -RemoveSource
This example encrypts C:\secrets.txt with a randomly generated DES key. The encrypted file would have an extension of '.Encrypted' and the source (decrypted) file would be removed.

.EXAMPLE
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Files' -Recurse | Protect-File -Algorithm AES -Key $key -RemoveSource
This example encrypts all of the files under the C:\Files directory using the key stored in the variable $key. The encrypted files would have the default extension of '.AES' and the source (decrypted) files would be removed.

.PARAMETER Suffix
Suffix of the encrypted file to be removed.

.PARAMETER RemoveSource
Removes the source (encrypted) file after decrypting.

.OUTPUTS
System.IO.FileInfo. Unprotect-File will return FileInfo with the SourceFile as an added NoteProperty

.EXAMPLE
Unprotect-File 'C:\secrets.txt.AES' $key
This example decrypts C:\secrets.txt.AES using the key stored in the variable $key. The decrypted file would remove the default extension of '.AES' and the source (encrypted) file would not be removed.

.EXAMPLE
Unprotect-File 'C:\secrets.txt.Encrypted' -Algorithm DES -Key $key -Suffix '.Encrypted' -RemoveSource
This example decrypts C:\secrets.txt.Encrypted using DES and the key stored in the variable $key. The decrypted file would remove the extension of '.Encrypted' and the source (encrypted) file would be removed.

.EXAMPLE
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Files' -Recurse | Unprotect-File -Algorithm AES -Key $key -RemoveSource
This example decrypts all of the files under the C:\Files directory using the key stored in the variable $key. The decrypted files would remove the default extension of '.AES' and the source (encrypted) files would be removed.

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key.

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","services.exe","services.exe",752,"-","-","-","SYSTEM, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","-","-","-","NT AUTHORITY","-","-","-","S-1-5-18",SYSTEM,SYSTEM,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",5,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","NT AUTHORITY","-",0x0,"-",0x3e7,"-","-","-","-","-",SYSTEM,"S-1-5-18","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Service,Info,776,"8,124","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2613,Logon,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",2

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","svchost.exe","svchost.exe","1,328","-","-","-","zhongli, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","-","S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001",zhongli,zhongli,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",4,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",0x0,"-",0xdd2952,"-","-","-","-","-",zhongli,"S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Batch,Info,776,"7,152","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2445,Logon,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",2

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","svchost.exe","svchost.exe","1,328","-","-","-","zhongli, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","-","S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001",zhongli,zhongli,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",4,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",0x0,"-",0xb55ebf,"-","-","-","-","-",zhongli,"S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Batch,Info,776,"8,124","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2397,Logon,"-","-","-","-",2

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe","svchost.exe","svchost.exe","1,328","-","-","-","zhongli, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-","-","-","S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001",zhongli,zhongli,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","%%1833","-","-","-",0,"-","-","-","-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",4,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","-","DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",0x0,"-",0x6e9f59,"-","-","-","-","-",zhongli,"S-1-5-21-1431998111-292960839-2456834407-1001","-","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Batch,Info,776,"2,568","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2344,Logon,"-","-","-","-",2

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key.

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key.

This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","C:\Windows\System32\services.exe","services.exe","services.exe",752,"SYSTEM, DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","-","NT AUTHORITY","S-1-5-18",SYSTEM,SYSTEM,"-","-","-","-","{96d05236-e7e2-0002-7b52-d096e2e7d801}",wineventlog,Security,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8","-",Negotiate,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","%%1842","-","-","-","-","-","%%1833","-","-",0,"-","{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}","Advapi  ",5,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",WORKGROUP,0x3e7,"DESKTOP-32EH6N8$","S-1-5-18","NT AUTHORITY",0x0,0x3e7,"-","-","-","-",SYSTEM,"S-1-5-18","-","-","%%1843","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-",4624,"Audit Success",0x3e7,Service,Info,776,"5,108","{54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d}","Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing",2279,Logon,"-","-","-","-",2
